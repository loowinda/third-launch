        <p id="about-text">PITIKGRAPHY-Z is the by-product of a dream, vision, and multiple businesses that was once handled by <b>Lorinda</b>, <b>Jane</b> and <b>Andrei</b>.
            By February of 2012, what first started as a passion project and keen interest about photography & culture, we, having little to absolutely no knowledge and resources about the new venture they are about to enter persistently continued and learned various ways on how to have a significant way of taking pictures and accustomed to the liking of people from all walks of life that definitively manifests an exceptional story that people could relate to. 
            With remarkable messages and unique artistry in each piece we shoot, we were able to reach out and highlight the likings in every person they came across and positively influence those who believe in what they do.
            Ever since then, the company has never stopped moving forward and has continuously evolved by further cultivating their relationship with every individual alike and the community as a whole.

        <p id="jane-text">For me photography is technically defined as an art of producing images such as paintings and drawings through the sensor of light. It is an art that comes from nature itself, hence making it pure, timeless, and exquisite in   form that is appreciated by whomever variously produce its purpose. Memories are immortalized through photography. It conjures up the best and worst moments of one's life in such a way that viewers can visualize a work of art. It is a time machine   that propels you through various time and universe dimensions by allowing   people to investigate things that aren't presently accessible. It captures wondrous paradise and makes us mesmerized by it everysingle time we need it. It sympathizes with us and watches our twilight and dawn without judgment.

            <p class="lorinda-success">photography can be a great way to meet new people, learn new things, and see the world from a different perspective. Even when I was an amateur photographer looking to improve my skills and now a professional photographer seeking new challenges, there is always something new to learn and explore in the world of photography.

        <p id="lorinda-text">To me, photography is about people being veritable and after that allowing us to depict that moment to remember it until the finish of time. This is the story that issues most: authentic people, real stories, certifiable minutes. I used to take pictures trying to stop time. I felt frantic to clutch past recollections, instead of living in the now. I in the long run understood that I need to take pictures not to look back, but rather with an end goal to commend the vitality of the present minute. Presently is all that we have. We are incredibly respected to have a gathering of photographers who work with us on some irregular week;s end. You should take two or three minutes to wind up progressively familiar with us.</p>

            <p id="andrei-text">Photography fulfills me. In way of capturing every moment, or even certain ones. Having to take something in remembrance is happiness. Growing up learning to capture portraits, landscapes, close-ups, etc helped me portray even relay my emotions about something, not limited to my emotions that is being let out through it. Photography let the creativity in me make sense. It's where the essence of pursuing it started. I saw the traits present in me, and realized that I can be a photographer. And as it persists, I constantly see in every place, person, thing from a point of view, I knew that this career is meant for me.

                <div class="faq1">
                    <h1 class="faq1-title">What types of photography do you do?</h1>
                    <p id="faq1-text">- We do alot of type of photography such as wedding, maternity, portrait, birthdays, baby shower, prenup and more. Come hit us up, we might have the service you're trying to find. Proceed to our how to reach us page.</p>
                    <h1 class="faq2-title">Why should I hire a professional photographer?</h1>
                    <p id="faq2-text">- We have the expertise and experience. By hiring a professional photographer you get quality images, and it enables you to actually feature your products, services, employees, and happy customers in the photos. A talented photographer know how to produce the photo shoot and create images that show your personality. Taking the responsibility of producing photography off your plate lets you actually be productive and enjoy the moment. </p>
                    <h1 class="faq3-title">How long will our session take?</h1>
                    <p id="faq3-text">- In our case, no. Deposits are non-refundable. We try to ensure that our time and effort to prepare things are worth it. We encourage our clients to think everything through before making decisions that might cause inconvience not only for themselves but also for us.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq2">
                    <h1 class="faq4-title">When will we get our finished prints?</h1>
                    <p id="faq4-text">- Usually it's 3-5 business days but it still depends in every type of photography we do and how booked our company is. Rest assured that we try to get done our finished products as soon as we can. </p>
                    <h1 class="faq5-title">What’s your cancellation/rescheduling policy?</h1>
                    <p id="faq5-text">- Cancellations and reschedules are no charge provided they are done 24 hours in advance of the scheduled shoot date/time. If I show up to a property and can’t get in or the shoot is cancelled by the agent/seller, the fee is P500 + 50% of the quoted amount. If I quoted P2,000, the fee would be P1,500. Yes, it’s near the cost of the full shoot, however I wasted my time showing up to the property and to me it’s unacceptable to cancel with no notice so the “punishment” is more firm. Same goes if you cancelled on the day of the shoot and I already prepared our studio for you. </p>
                    <h1 class="faq6-title">Can we see photography case studies and example portfolio?</h1>

                    <h1 class="faq7-title">How do we mitigate technical issues at the event?</h1>
                    <p id="faq7-text">- Photographers have at least two professional camera bodies, several lenses and a multitude of accessories specific to your shoot. Well maintained equipment is very reliable these days so it is very unlikely there will be an impact to capturing great photos at your event. </p>
                    <h1 class="faq8-title">Who is my contact before and during the event?</h1>
                    <p id="faq8-text">- PITIKGRAPHY-Z likes to personally call every client before the event or shoot for a quick chat. We believe personal service works better in person. At the event, the head photographer will be your primary contact point and direct any second shooters. We’ll advise who the head photographer is for your event during the pre-event phone call and emails.</p>
